# JeStErS-ITZ-code

This is pretty much a repository so that i can keep track of changes

code can be found in code folder

Changes made to the code are documented in the logs folder

  JeStErS-ITZ-code/logs/logs is a mistake dont touch that folder

concepts that can be copy pasted from .txt files can be found in the concepts folder

and remember:
