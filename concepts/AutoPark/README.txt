pros of parking autonomous:
-lets alliance partner have full control of stationary goal/center so entanglement isn't likely
-sets up driver nicely because the autonomous will leave robot near a mobile goal ready for loading

cons of parking autonomous:
-VERY unlikely this program will win autonomous bonus on its own
-will have to rely on alliance partner to win autonomous bonus
-if alliance partner doesn't utilize stationary goal/center, parking autonomous is wasted effort
-if robot pushes through a bunch of cones on way to parking square, ref might disqualify <SG9>
 (not very likely, but something to keep in mind)
