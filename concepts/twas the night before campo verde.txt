'Twas the night before Campo Verde, when all throu' the trailer
Not a motor was PTC'ing, not even a chainbar;
The sensors were sitting in the Jesters' cabinet,
Waiting and hoping that they would be used soon;
The robots were nestled all snug in their boxes,
While visions of VEX Worlds danced in their circuits
