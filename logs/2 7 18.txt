changes made today:
-tidied up code, updated subsystems.h description of chainbar motors define statement because we don't use power expander
-made a function to reset both drivetrain encoders, needs testing just to see it actually works
-made a smarter auto tank drive that would reduce # of lines of code needed, making code easier to read
  needs testing & implementation


tests done today:
-nothing on partner control seems to be working
  checking if the controller batteries are the problem
    batteries seem to be the problem but chainbar is weird (most likely PTC)
