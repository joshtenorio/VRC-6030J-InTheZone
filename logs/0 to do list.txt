
-need documentation in every header files


 -rework 20 point autonomous so it scores and goes faster 
 

-autostack

  fix
    maybe move autostack to its own c file?
    because zack has his autostack in a different file
  test
    making calls to normal opcontrol functions for chainbar and cone manipulators so it might not get stuck
    might have to remove opcontrolchainbar and conegrabber in opcontrol.c if this doesnt really work (TEST THIS)
    test to see if every other subsystem works ok after and before using autostack
