
-need documentation in every header files


 -rework 20 point autonomous so it scores and goes faster 
 

-autostack

  fix
    maybe move autostack to its own c file?
    because zack has his autostack in a different file
  test
    test to see if every other subsystem works ok after using autostack
  improve
    make autostack go faster (reduce the 750 ms delay to something like 400)
    make autostack do 4 cones, if time permits (focus on 20 point autonomous first)
