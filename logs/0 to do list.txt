
-need documentation in every header files


-autonomous
  20 pt right side
    finish working on it
    time it, make it go faster if possible
 

-autostack

  fix
    maybe move autostack to its own c file?
    because zack has his autostack in a different file
  test
    test to see if every other subsystem works ok after using autostack
  improve
    make autostack go faster (reduce the 750 ms delay to something like 400)
    make autostack do 4 cones, if time permits (focus on 20 point autonomous first)
