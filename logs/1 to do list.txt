-for chainbar:
  make go slower <>
  hold last position <>
  PID for stacking
  
  
  
- get someone to check PID.c



-need documentation in library.h



-when relevant sensors are attached make PIDs for:
  mobile goal
  autostacking (remove cone and make chainbar/linear gear go up) and for driver loads
  auto reset <>
 
 

-roast michelle (execute immediately)



-think of autonomous plan
  stack preload on stationary goal (sensors on drivetrain, linear gear, chainbar, cone manipulator sensor not needed)
  drive to parking square (no sensors needed)
  
  
  
-tweak kP values when we have relevant sensors (zieglers-nichol tuning method)
