changes made today:
  -made lots of progress on auto stack
  -discussed changes needed on autonomous
    -make faster, maybe instead of doing that weird turn maneuver just go backwards after picking up goal
    -after 20 pt autonomous is done, design one for left side so we're not hogging one side
    -use a VEX LCD for auton chooser if time is available
    
tests done today:
  -shameful hardware
