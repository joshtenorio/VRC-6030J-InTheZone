changes made today:
-made concept chainbar better
-chainbar encoder got kicked off so now we have no sensors YAAAAAAAAAAAY
-commented out the relevant code that used chainbar encoder
-maxed out linear gear speeds (speeds now 127 and -127)
-if we can get shaft encoder or potentiometer for mobile goal then we could probably make a PID function for driver control
-check to do list for stuff to do




tests done today:
-full robot test for driver practice
