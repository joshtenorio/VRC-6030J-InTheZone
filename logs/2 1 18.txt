changes made today:
-made a change to chainbar so holdLastPosition only runs when chainbar is out and about 
  AKA chainbar will not running when it resting on mobile goal lifter
-want to test some turns for autonomous using autonomous
-also testing auton for skills

-also linear gear can't climb really high
  removing rails because it created too much friction (we originally looked for a software solution but no result)
  
-issue in autonomous where chainbar goes too far
  could try using a while loop just in case motor speed isn't updating or delay is too short to set motor speed for chainbar

tests done today:
-chainbar dontHoldLastPositionWhenISaySo tests:
  test 1: it works
  
-90 degree turn is 225/-225 for encoders
