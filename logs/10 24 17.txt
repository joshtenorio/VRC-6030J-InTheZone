changes made today:
-lowered chainbar speed to 70 from 100
-cleaned up mobile goal code (from if/else to if/elseif/else)
-made chainbar code easier to read
-added #define for controller ports, havent implemented them into code
-removed #define pot coneg because were not putting a potentiometer there
-cleaned up cone grabber cone
-cleaned up linear gear code

tests done today:

Chainbar test
-testing to see if chainbar actually works
-test one: chainbar goes pretty fast, chainbar falls down if it goes up and no input is activated
           speeds could be lowered, or hardware team is to blame. trying lowered speeds for test 2
-test two: chainbar is slower speed (probably more manageble for driver) but still falls if input
           is not held
-conclusion: hypothesis of chainbar working is true and supported, but improvements can be made

elaina's interrogation of gabe #1:
-interrogatting to find what gabe is like
-test one: gabe likes the color crimson
-test two: gabe likes bunnies and cats
-conclusion: liking crimson and bunnies and cats dont go together

Mobile goal test:
-testing to see if it works without mobile goal
-test one: mobile goal code works, but gets caught on a motor
-conclusion: hardware team is very shameful
