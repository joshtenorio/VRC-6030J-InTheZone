changes made today:
-uncommented some parts in skills auton (which is also match auton)
-reduced speed for auton skills going forward after the 135 degree turn left
-changed chainbar PID deadband to reference target value instead of current
  needs testing
-also replacing short wire extensions with longer ones
  should improve robot performance
-removed unused variables in autostack
  variables were buttonState and prevButtonState
-also removed linear gear stuff in autostack, so now opcontrolStack just uses chainbar and cone grabber motors
  should research PROS tasks
-replaced some tank drive movements in auton skills with the smarter autonomous tank drive function
  needs testing
-lowered chainbar speeds in driver control



tests done today:
-new chainbar speeds:
  robot can still stack
  
-testing autostack  
test 1:
  it goes to driver load then stop
  robot doesnt respond to any input from joystick after that
  rearranged code so it goes to mobile goal first
  
test 2:
  same result as last time, gets stuck at going to driver load
  making calls to normal opcontrol functions for chainbar and cone manipulators so it might not get stuck
    might have to remove opcontrolchainbar and conegrabber in opcontrol.c if this doesnt really work
  rubber band going wrong way
test 3:
  same result as last time
  redid printf statement in a while loop
  also added break statements
