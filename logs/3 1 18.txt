changes made today:
-renamed auton10PtRightExperimental to auton10PtRightSynth
-made 135 degree left turn in synch auton less stronger (it turned too much last time)
-replaced rubber bands on chainbar, might mess up auton and maybe autostack (but mostly just auton)
-drivers practiced
-made cone manipulator stop rolling before robot moves back in 
-making left side auton, does samething as right side auton
-distance between wall and robot on left side for alligning auton is ~13.25 cm or 3 inches ish
-add another condition for break statement in autostack
  AKA if panic button is pressed, the while loop in autostack will terminate (using break statements)
-made an autoHoldChainBar function that should help chainbar in autonomous, implemented it into autonomous (needs testing)
  reason why chainbar wasn't working/very inconsistent was because code was setting speed once (cb speed wasnt updating)
  new target values for new untested autoHoldChainBar function is now 72 instead of 50 something

tests done today:
autonomous with synch (go forward and mobile goal out at same time)
  test 1: chainbar didn't go up high enough, turns too much at end also
    making chainbar go higher (65 -> 70), reducing turn from 550 -> 500

autonomous without synch (raise chainbar, take out mobile goal, then go forward)
  test 1: chainbar didn't go high enough  
    raising chainbar from 58->70
  test 2: chainbar doesn't go high enough still, everything else is ok
    raising cb, 70-> 75
  test 3: chainbar goes too far, everything else ok
    less raising cb, 75 -> 73
  test 4: cb goes too far,
    reverting to 60
  test 5: still goes too far  
    reducing 60 -> 58, and reducing chainbar kP from 0.8 to 0.6
  test 6: isn't enough to raise chainbar
    going to raise target from 58 -> 60
  test 7: cb goes too far 
    reducing kP to 0.5 and target to 50
  test 8: it works
    testing two more times with same code for consistency
  test 9: works 
  test 10: works
  
autonomous left side (scores at least 12 points, should do same thing as right side)
  test 1: went a bit too far after 135 degree turn, reducing the target from 300-270
  test 2: chainbar went too far 
    reducing cb target from 50 -> 48
  test 3: robot moves too far after 135 degree turn, reducing it from 270 ->220
  test 4: reducing 135 degree turn (550 -> 520) and making it 
  test 5: works, but chainbar could be tad bit higher, and could go further into 10 pt zone 120 ->150 and chainbar 54 -> 57
  test 6: works ish, making robot go more forward into 10 pt zone 150->200 and i think chainbar ok
  test 7: pretty decent i think its ok. running 2 more times for consistency
  test 8: works but could be better, we'll prefer right side auton though
