changes made today:
-went over P function in PID.c
-learned technical writing 101 from Barin
-made proper documentation for P function
-made mobile goal function a little bit better
-man ternary operators are fun
-also improved linear gear code
-and cone grabber
-and chainbar
-started putting stuff in autoLibrary.c
-made a thing for autonomous chainbar




tests done today:
-hardware team tested robot
  everything except mobile goal AFAIK
  it works, it can also pick up cones
  would be better if they waited for PID control for chainbar
  and if they fixed cortex stuff first
