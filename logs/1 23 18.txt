changes made today:
-hopefully can test linear gear pid and autonomous
  consult dafsss.jpg or something like that in concept folder for autonomous plan
  right tankDrive going backwards second time is 
-changed linear gear speed going down from -127 to -60

tests done today:
-linear gear pid 
  doesnt seem to work but it looks like hardware problems
  if linear gear reaches a certain point it just falls down
  also sometimes after it falls down it wont go back up
    this issue is REALLY inconsistent
    its probably a hardware problem
      its the zipties

-barin was having field reset teams practice so couldn't test autonomous
  one of their times was 1 minute 22 seconds
  also had some squires un set the field
